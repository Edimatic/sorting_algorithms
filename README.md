		C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Sorting algorithms are techniques used to arrange elements in a specific order within a data structure like an array or a list. The C programming language is often used to implement these algorithms. Big O notation is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its time complexity or space complexity.


Here are some common sorting algorithms in C along with their average-case time complexities in Big O notation:

        Bubble Sort: Time Complexity: O(n^2)

        Selection Sort: Time Complexity: O(n^2)

        Insertion Sort: Time Complexity: O(n^2)

        Merge Sort: Time Complexity: O(n log n)

        Quick Sort: Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average case)


These are just a few examples, and there are many other sorting algorithms with different time complexities. It's important to choose the right sorting algorithm based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data you are working with.
